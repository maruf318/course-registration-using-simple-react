Question: Discuss how you managed the state in your assignment project. <br>
Answer: I have used useState and useEffect. Mainly, I have used 4 useState (to store json data after fetching, to store the selected course upon clicking, to store the total credit hour and remaining credits). Later, I have send the data where in other components. And I used useEffect to fetch json data and later I used useState to store them.
